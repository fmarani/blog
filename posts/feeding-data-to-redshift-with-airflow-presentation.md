The presentation I gave at Europython 2017 in Rimini. The talk is divided in 3 parts: some guiding principles on architecting data pipelines, an introduction to Apache Airflow and the last part is about specifically working with Amazon Redshift. The experience in these tools comes from building an analytics engine for meetups, where historical reports, trend analysis and data enrichment are critical factors.
