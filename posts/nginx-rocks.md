I have installed Nginx some time ago on one of our busiest servers on our partner's networks, i promised i would have blogged about this and now it's about time. This server only serves images of products sold thorugh our e-commerce site. The first configuration was only a simple web server which was serving already resized images directly, due to the massive amount of images and the cleaning of it which was taking days, i decided to use Nginx in reverse proxy mode. I have to say i am still impressed, after 6-7 months, about this software. I've never had to restart it one time except for little configuration tweaks.

This software is so good that we decided to put images that compose emails on this server as well. This is kind of critical because, after the nightly mail-out, there are 5-6 hours in the morning with constants spikes of traffic. Again, absolutely no side-effects, Nginx relentlessly serves gigabytes and gigabytes of images as if nothing happened.

This is our configuration:

```nginx
# FIRST TIER TO ANSWER HTTP REQUESTS FOR IMAGES
# SECOND TIER IS APACHE

user  apache;
worker_processes  4; // same as number of cpu cores

error_log  logs/error.log;

}

}

error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
location = /50x.html {
root   html;
}

location ~ /\.ht {
deny  all;
}
}
}
```

This configuration is able to serve a constant flux of 1.5Mb/s, which i reckon is about 200 requests/sec for an average file of 3Kb. Most of the requests are served directly by Nginx, some others go through to Apache which has in average 200 connnections opened.

The version of nginx used is 0.7.65 compiled from sources. This because new 0.7 has an improved reverse caching module which was needed for this.

EDIT: I've been doing some statistics on a recent normal day: 100Gb of traffic and 25-30 million images transferred. Server load was below the limit and most of it coming from Apache. Not bad at all!
